        <hr>
        <p>this is a website made by nico, a 15 year old idiot who likes coding and making stuff.<br>
            this currently serves as a showcase for programs i've made through <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a><br>
            and will also be my actual website for my year-long project!</p>
