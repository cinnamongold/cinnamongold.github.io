    <p>This script takes your inventory (inv.txt) and path (path.txt) and merges them together to remove any items you already own. This script may be buggy with elements with an "=" sign, but should work otherwise. No extra dependencies require installation.</p>

    <p><strong>You must install pyperclip in this script's environment! </strong>This script takes your outputted file from the pathfilter script and makes it easier to grind by copying combos to your clipboard. You may press enter to delete the line and move to the next one, or skip to NOT delete the line and still move on. Your text file will <i>not</i> be affected until you type "quit" (not pressing Alt+F4 or close window)</p>
